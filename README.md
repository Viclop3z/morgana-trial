# üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Morgana‚Äôs Trial ‚Äì Round Table 2.0

This solution was developed for **Morgana‚Äôs Trial**, a .NET challenge focused on integrating **Umbraco CMS 15** with a secure, scalable **.NET Web API**. The goal was to expose selected Umbraco Management API features to external clients via a custom API layer.

- **Database:** SQLite (included in the solution)
- **Purpose:** Hosts the CMS and Management API endpoints.

### 2. `UmbracoBridge` (.NET Web API)
- **Framework:** .NET 9
- **Purpose:** Exposes endpoints to interact with Umbraco‚Äôs Management API securely via client credentials.
- **Features:**
  - Validated endpoints.
  - Token-based authentication with caching.
  - OpenAPI / Swagger documentation.
  - Clean architecture: services, commands, queries, validators, contracts.
  - Unit testing using `xUnit` and `Moq`.

## üåê Exposed Endpoints

| Method | Route                               | Description                                      |

| POST   | `/api/management/documenttype`      | Creates a new Document Type in Umbraco         |
| DELETE | `/api/management/delete/{id}`       | Deletes a Document Type by ID                  |

### ‚úÖ Validation Rules for POST `/documenttype`:
- `alias`, `name`, and `description` must **not be empty**.
- `icon` must **start with `icon-`**.

## üß™ Unit Tests

Unit tests using `xUnit` and `Moq` cover:
- `ManagementController`: success and failure scenarios.
- `TokenService`: token acquisition and error handling.
- `HealthCheckService`: Umbraco connectivity errors.
- `DocumentTypeValidator`: for all rule cases (valid, missing fields, wrong icon format, etc.)

Run tests with:

```bash
dotnet test
